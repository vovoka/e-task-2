# Math quation humaniser

The script contains a set of functions for converting a mathematical equations expressed in digits and mathematical symbols to a sequence of corresponded words.  

The task border rules were not described precisely. Therefore some of them were chosen by the code author and implemented. All of them are described in correspond docstrings.  

Task recommends to use pytest for the code tests. File ```test_task_2.py``` contains set of pytest tests. Unfortunately, pytest does not support python type hints and f-strings. That's why these features aren't used through the code.
